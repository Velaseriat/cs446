1. Rails know what migrations to run by the schema_migrations. When we worked with laravel the schema table listed what migrations were run and when, and I suspect it works the same way here in rails. If one was to revert a migration, then the corresponding migration would be removed from the schema table.

2. The up function contains code for implementing the actual database migration, while down is the opposite, that is capable of undoing what the up function did.

3. An irreversible migration is a migration that contains commands that are not reversible. Something like remove_index cannot be reversed without manual commands. In the API, it states that the down method of irreversible migrations should rase an ActiveRecord::IrreversibleMigration exception.
